# Exercise 1 - Warm-up


# A) ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Using {haven}, read in the ADSL ("/datasets/ADAM/ADSL") and ADAE data ("/datasets/ADAM/ADAE")


# B) ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Using the {tidyverse}:

# (i) Use ADSL to calculate “Big N” for each treatment (TRT01A)


# (ii) Generate counts of distinct subject (USUBJID) AE’s by 
#      - system organ class (AEBODSYS) and 
#      - reported term (AETERM), and by 
#      - treatment (TRT01A)


# (iii) Merge on/join the Big N values and calculate percentages (pct) of each
# reported term by system organ class and treatment
